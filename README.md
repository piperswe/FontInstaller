#  FontInstaller
## Install fonts on Windows without Administrator permission

This program came along when I was doing a project for my high school graphic design class and wanted to use a font that
isn't installed by default with Windows or Adobe Creative Suite. I found @tsukasa's [RegisterFont](/tsukasa/RegisterFont)
and loved it for a few months. My graphic design teacher was wanting to find a way for students to install fonts (so our
designs aren't so boring with default fonts), so I whipped this easy GUI up. It allows you to simply add fonts to the list,
restart your program, and the font will be available. It adds itself to the Startup folder, so you don't have to worry
about fonts deregistering when you log out, and it also has an auto-update function* that always keeps you up to date with
the latest bug fixes and features.

\* Coming in version 1.1, you must compile the code to get it currently. Also, it's useless until 1.1.1 comes out, as when
you compile the current code it will constantly bug you to "update" to v1.0.1. At least it will tell you when 1.1 is released.
